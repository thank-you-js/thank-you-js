Dear JS,

JS changed the way we develop web applications and influenced many developers
and projects.

We want to thank [Brendan Eich](https://github.com/BrendanEich),
[Lars Bak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_(computer_programmer)), the
[node group](https://github.com/nodejs), JS developers, contributors, and
all the people involved in making the JS language and its ecosystem a better
place for everyone.

Thank you so much for all that you have done and do.

Signed,

- Mathias Reker ([@MathiasReker](https://github.com/MathiasReker)), Full Stack Web Developer, Denmark
